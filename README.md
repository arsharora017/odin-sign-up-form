Please feel free to visit my sample signup form. It is created mostly using HTML and CSS. However, JS is used to validate the password pattern and also confirm if it was entered correctly.

Note: Check my original repo for the project at https://github.com/arsharora017/odin-sign-up-form-original.git

Note: This version is only desktop compatible.
